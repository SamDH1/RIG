# RIG
A mountain bike creation tool, allowing the user to create, edit, and delete a bike to their profile, with peace of mind knowing each part will fit with each other and use the details for later usage

# The Tech Inside
RIG features a few elements to increase the usability of the website. For example, it has been created with a responsive layout and contains elements that hide/show based on screen size to increase usability with the usageof JS.

It uses a caching system (SMARTY) to allow for quicker load times if the user has previously visited the webpage.

It demonstrates AJAX through the bike building tool, and shows a user profile area. This includes hashing and salting of the users password for high level of security.

The website is also based heavily on Material guidelines from Google
